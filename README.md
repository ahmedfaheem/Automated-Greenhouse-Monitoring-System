# Automated-Greenhouse-Monitoring-System
This project ‏demonstrates‏ the implementation of a automated greenhouse monitoring system using two Atmega32 AVR microcontroller. The system features an LCD, keypad, DHT11 sensor, LDR (light-dependent resistor), switch, buzzer, LEDs,soil moisture and a DC motors controlled. The system provides a user interface for interaction and access control.

# Features
• Choose the plant you want to grow or customize the weather you want.
    i. Tomatoes.
   ii. Corn.
  iii. Wheat.
   iv. Custom.

• Measure some current information.
    i. Humidity.
   ii. Temperature.
  iii. Soil water.
   iv. Light intensity.

• Display current information on the LCD.

• Alert if weather was not suitable and and the system will run to improve it.
    buzzer will work and LCD will write the problem.

# Usage
    To use the system you can only interact with the LCD and the keypad.
